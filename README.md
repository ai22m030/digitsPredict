## Description

The group project will lead through many of the steps of software development.  

1. Develop a machine learning model to predict digits based on a picture
2. Use Rest API to build a service
3. Use Docker to containerize the service
4. Use k8s for container infrastructure
5. Asynchronous communication between user and server

## Assignments

### [01] Create two applications for training / consuming the model.
The training application should use public resources as input, train a model to correctly classify images and persist the model.
The consumer application should load a model, load an image and return the predicted number.
